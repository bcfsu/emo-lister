=> #123 - BUDDY NIELSEN (SENSES FAIL)
February 05, 2018 Tom Mullen

We talk about Senses Fail's new album "If There Is Light, It Will Find You" and how the band got their start, the crazy time in the mid-00s when everyone was getting signed. Buddy speaks candidly about what bands were thinking as the emo boom took hold in NJ and in other parts of the country and world. A fun chat and one where he didnâ€™t hold back. I loved hearing his take on emo and the shape it took when Senses Fail were gaining popularity. Thanks for listening!
