# EmoLister

Welcome to Emo Lister!  This app will show you information gathered from the website washedupemo.com.  The app will show you the most recent podcast interviews recorded, as well as a summary of each interview.  Stay tuned for more features, such as listing the recent years' Emo Awards.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'emo_lister'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emo_lister

## Usage

Run this app from the command line.  The list of recent podcasts will be ordered by number. Select the number of the episode you would like a summary of, or type 'list' to show the episode titles again, or 'exit' to leave the app.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
